 *WARNING*

  DAL is linked with this .so library, so that in can be used here.
  DAL in turn is using drvrutil library in case of ppc4.

  Workaround, that allows this .so to be load
  from within installation program is needed.
  Whithout it -- dlopen will fail because of unresovled symbols.
  dlerror reports -- Symbol not found: "IocModulPointer" "IocGetErrorMessage"

  This functions are called only if DaEnableAccess() is called with IOMMAP
  requested as an access method.

  So *DO NOT* call DaEnableAccess() with IOMMAP parameter!
  Use *ONLY* IOCTL access method!

  Otherwise two stub functions will be called, which is not what you'll expect.
